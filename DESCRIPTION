Description: Implementation of a variety of  methods to compute to compute the 
    robustness of ecological networks with binary interactions. In particular, 
    using the Stochastic Block Model and its bipartite counterpart, the 
    Latent Block Model to put a parametric model on the network, allows
    the comparison of the robustness of networks differing 
    in richness and connectance. It also deals with networks that are partially 
    sampled or with missing values.
