Description: Implementation of a variety of methods to compute
    the robustness of ecological interaction networks with binary interactions. 
    In particular, using the Stochastic Block Model and its bipartite
    counterpart, the Latent Block Model to put a parametric model on the
    network, allows the comparison of the robustness of networks differing
    in richness and connectance. It also deals with networks that are
    partially sampled and/or with missing values. The methodology is described
    in the following preprint: <arXiv:1910.10512>.
