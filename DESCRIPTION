Description: This package use the Stochastic Block Model and its bipartite
    counterpart, the Latent Block Model to compute the robustness of ecological
    networks with binary interactions. By setting a parametric model on the 
    network, it allows the comparison of the robustness of networks differing 
    in size and connectance. It also deals with networks that are partially 
    sampled or with missing values.
